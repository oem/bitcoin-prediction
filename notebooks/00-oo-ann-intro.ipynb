    "\n",
    "There was a short burst of interest again in the 1980s, caused by new architectures and improved training machines. But by 1990 the interest died down again, instead other, powerful ML techniques like Support Vector Machines were favored.\n",

    "There has been a surge of interest in ANNs for a few years now, among other things caused by huge datasets available for training these days and the tremendous increase in computing power, mostly caused by the gaming industry and the development of powerful GPUs."
